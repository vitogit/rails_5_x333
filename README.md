 My own task manager system.
 Developed in Rails 5

 The basic of the system is to

 1. Select 3 goals that you want to complete in the next 3 months
 2. For each goals select the 3 most immediately actions that you can
    take to move in your goal direction.
 3. Do it in the first 3 days of the week.
